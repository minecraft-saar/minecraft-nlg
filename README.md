A sentence generator for the Minecraft domain
========================================

This repository contains a sentence generator that generates natural-language instructions in the Minecraft domain. Based on a 3D representation of the Minecraft world and an instruction action, the system (1) translates the numeric representation of the world into a relation-based one and (2) computes the optimal sentence that expresses the instruction action. This is based on an [IRTG grammar](https://github.com/coli-saar/alto) with (learned or generated) rule weights.

## Running the sentence generator

The sentence generator is not primarily intended to run standalone; instead, it is imported by the [Simple Architect](https://github.com/minecraft-saar/simple-architect), and used there to realize instruction actions generated by the planner.

You can still compile and run minecraft-nlg standalone:

```
./gradlew shadowJar
java -jar build/libs/minecraft-nlg-<version>-SNAPSHOT-all.jar -c -m <world.json> -i <grammar.irtg>`
```

This runs minecraft-nlg in continuous mode (`-c`), in which it reads instruction actions from the console. Here are some files you can use as input to try this out:

 * Use the grammar in [src/main/resources/de/saar/coli/minecraft/minecraft.irtg](https://github.com/minecraft-saar/minecraft-nlg/blob/master/src/main/resources/de/saar/coli/minecraft/minecraft.irtg)
 * Use the world model in [examples/test-world.json](https://github.com/minecraft-saar/minecraft-nlg/blob/master/examples/test-world.json)
 * Use the instruction action `build:b7` (instructing the user to place the block `b7`; note that you can only refer to blocks, not to locations).


## Versions:

 - inlg 2019: checkout the inlg2019 tag, compile and run
   `java -cp build/libs/minecraft-nlg-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar de.saar.coli.minecraft.experiments.Inlg2019`
   It will show the generated sentences on the command line.
